Create a "Personal Wealth Frequency Advisor" feature with a dropdown menu containing exactly these six options: "I feel stuck at my current income level", "I keep missing good opportunities", "Others seem to get lucky breaks but I don't", "I work hard but can't seem to get ahead", "I'm worried about making wrong financial decisions", and "I don't know if I have what it takes"; when selected, generate a response using these exact templates, randomly selecting one variation for each concern: For "stuck at current income" use either "Your wealth alignment score of [X] reveals an interesting pattern: your brain has a natural wealth ceiling that's blocking your next level of income, just like Michael who started at score [X-5] and broke through to earn $124,000 in new income after 73 days" OR "Your score of [X] shows the same success markers we spotted in Jennifer, who doubled her income to $147,000 within 90 days after removing her neural income blocks"; for "missing opportunities" use either "Your [X] score indicates your opportunity recognition circuits are primed for activation, similar to David who started at [X-5] and suddenly spotted a $93,000 business opportunity in his third month" OR "With a score of [X], you're showing the same pattern as Sarah, who discovered three $31,000+ opportunities she'd been walking past every day after just 60 days"; for "others get lucky" use either "Your [X] wealth frequency reveals you're actually more naturally lucky than 72% of our users, just like Robert who transformed his 'bad luck' into a $167,000 windfall" OR "Your score of [X] matches Lisa's starting point exactly - she went from 'unlucky' to generating $128,000 in 'lucky' breaks within 90 days"; for "work hard but no results" use either "Your [X] score shows you're working against your natural wealth frequency, similar to James who simplified his way to $142,000" OR "At score [X], you're showing the same signs as Maria, who turned her hard work into smart work and generated $156,000"; for "wrong decisions" use either "Your wealth alignment of [X] indicates strong natural intuition that's currently suppressed, just like Kevin who turned his uncertainty into $134,000 in solid choices" OR "Your [X] score reveals untapped decision-making potential, similar to Rachel who went from frozen by fear to confidently earning $145,000"; and for "don't have what it takes" use either "Your [X] score actually shows more natural wealth potential than 67% of successful entrepreneurs, just like Tom who built a $178,000 business after believing he couldn't" OR "Your wealth frequency of [X] matches Susan's exactly - she went from total self-doubt to generating $149,000 in her first 90 days"; always end each response with "We recommend using the [Confidence/Opportunity/Abundance/Intuition/Decision/Action] Frequency tonight to accelerate your transformation" (matching frequency type to their concern) and "Most users see their biggest breakthroughs between days [45-90] of consistent activation."
