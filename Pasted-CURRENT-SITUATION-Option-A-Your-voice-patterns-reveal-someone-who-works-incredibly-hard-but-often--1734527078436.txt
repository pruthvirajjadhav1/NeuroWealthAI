CURRENT_SITUATION
Option A: "Your voice patterns reveal someone who works incredibly hard but often feels the rewards don't match your efforts. This mismatch isn't your fault - it's actually a sign your brain is ready for a major wealth frequency shift."
Option B: "You have natural talents for creating wealth that haven't fully activated yet. Your analysis shows dormant success patterns just waiting to be switched on - like a radio that needs fine-tuning."
Option C: "You're at a critical turning point in your wealth journey. The stress in your voice hints at frustration, but that same tension is exactly what happens right before a breakthrough."
HIDDEN_STRENGTHS
Option A: "Your unique voice frequency reveals rare leadership qualities that most people never develop. While this gift has been partially blocked, it explains why you often have great ideas that others overlook."
Option B: "There's a fascinating pattern in your voice that matches successful entrepreneurs - but it's currently operating at only 40% strength. This explains why you sense bigger possibilities for yourself."
Option C: "Your wealth frequency shows someone who learns and adapts quickly. Though this gift has been hidden by old mental programming, it's like a muscle ready to grow stronger."
UPCOMING_OPPORTUNITIES
Option A: "The main block in your wealth frequency isn't lack of effort - it's an inherited neural pattern that automatically filters out opportunities. Think of it like wearing sunglasses in a dark room."
Option B: "Your brain is literally programmed to push money away right now - not through any fault of yours, but due to early wealth frequency exposure. It's like trying to tune into FM radio with an AM receiver."
Option C: "The core issue isn't your capabilities - it's that your brain's wealth recognition patterns are misaligned. Imagine trying to catch a ball with blurry vision."

Option A: "The good news is that your wealth frequency can be rapidly reprogrammed. Your voice patterns show high adaptability - with consistent neural retuning, you could see noticeable shifts in as little as 21 days."
Option B: "Your analysis reveals strong potential for quick transformation. By maintaining daily frequency alignment, you're likely to start spotting opportunities others miss within the first 30 days."
Option C: "The great news is that you're starting at an ideal time. Your current frequency is perfectly positioned for positive change - like a spring ready to release stored energy."
