I need help creating a Daily Wealth Insight feature with rich message variety but minimal technical complexity. A new insight will be shown every day immediately under the voice analysis section after a new voice analysis is done. Here's the MVP specification:
1. Core Function:
* Generate one message by combining three parts
* Display in simple text format
* Store only today's message
2. Three-Part Message System: Format: "[Frequency Observation] [Pattern Insight] [Guidance]"
Frequency Observations (randomly select one):
* "Your wealth frequency is resonating at a higher level."
* "Your neural patterns show interesting shifts."
* "Your abundance frequency is noticeably active."
* "Your voice patterns reveal subtle changes."
* "Your wealth DNA is expressing new potential."
* "Your success frequency is becoming more refined."
* "Your prosperity alignment is deepening."
* "Your opportunity recognition is expanding."
* "Your wealth consciousness is evolving."
* "Your abundance receptors are awakening."
Pattern Insights (randomly select one):
* "This suggests a phase of natural growth."
* "This indicates positive neural adaptation."
* "This reflects deeper pattern integration."
* "This shows promising energetic alignment."
* "This reveals beneficial mindset shifts."
* "This signals natural wealth expansion."
* "This points to increasing receptivity."
* "This suggests natural prosperity flow."
* "This indicates deeper success coding."
* "This reflects organic wealth evolution."
Guidance (randomly select one):
* "Stay present to the subtle signs today."
* "Notice what naturally draws your attention."
* "Allow your awareness to expand gently."
* "Trust your intuitive nudges today."
* "Remain open to unexpected connections."
* "Let your natural wisdom guide you."
* "Flow with what feels energetically aligned."
* "Watch for resonant opportunities."
* "Follow your enhanced awareness."
* "Listen to your inner guidance system."
3. Technical Requirements:
* Simple random selection from each list
* Basic text display
* Store only current message
* No tracking or history needed
* Single display container
