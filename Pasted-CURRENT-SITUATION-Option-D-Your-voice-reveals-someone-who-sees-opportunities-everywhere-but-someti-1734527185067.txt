CURRENT_SITUATION
Option D: "Your voice reveals someone who sees opportunities everywhere but sometimes hesitates to grab them. This isn't lack of courage - it's actually your brain's wealth frequency being slightly out of tune."
Option E: "There's a unique pattern in your voice that shows untapped wealth potential. Like a radio catching fragments of an amazing song, you're picking up pieces of success but not yet the full signal."
Option F: "Your analysis shows someone who's been playing by all the old rules of money, but your inner wisdom knows there's a better way. This tension in your wealth frequency is actually perfectly normal right before a major breakthrough."
HIDDEN_STRENGTHS
Option D: "Your voice carries a wealth frequency pattern we often see in self-made millionaires - but it's running at just 30% power. Think of it like a muscle that just needs the right training to grow stronger."
Option E: "There's something remarkable in your voice pattern - a natural ability to spot opportunities that others miss. While this gift has been partially muted, it explains your occasional flashes of brilliant insight."
Option F: "Your wealth frequency shows an unusually strong connection between creativity and money-making abilities. Though this connection is currently dimmed, it's like a light bulb just waiting for more power."
UPCOMING_OPPORTUNITIES
Option D: "The real block isn't your mindset - it's an outdated wealth frequency that's stuck in protection mode. Imagine trying to download high-speed internet through an old dial-up modem."
Option E: "Your brain's success patterns are currently set to 'safe mode' - not because you chose this, but because of early programming. It's like driving with the parking brake on."
Option F: "The core challenge isn't your work ethic - it's that your neural pathways are running on old wealth software. Think of it like using an outdated phone that can't run the latest apps."
PERSONALIZED_ADVICE
Option D: "Here's the exciting part: your voice patterns show unusually fast adaptability to new frequencies. With consistent neural alignment, you could start experiencing 'lucky breaks' within the first 14 days."
Option E: "What makes your case special is how quickly your brain can adopt new wealth patterns. Most people need 60 days to see changes, but your frequency suggests potential shifts in just 28 days."
Option F: "You're actually in an ideal position for transformation. Your current wealth frequency is like a coiled spring - once released through daily alignment, change could happen faster than you'd expect."
